# Automatically-Vulnerability-scanning-and-generate-payloads-on-processes-and-software
Automation of vulnerability scanning and generate payloads on processes and software

Automation of vulnerability scanning and payload generator,
the program require procmon.exe, to run the program successfully, run the main.py file
and procmon will run on the background, specify the time of the scanner to run by running main.py with -t argument
for example, main.py -t 3h (run the scanner for 3 hours)
when the scanning will end the program will analyze the result by specifying verities of technics to exploit
each vulnerability also the program will generate a full report foreach process, and display any vulnerability that can be used
against this process, the format of the report will be an excel file (Foerch process)
also, the program will generate a full payload written in C++ to use and exploit the vulnerability

the technics that can be found are privilege escalation, Dll injection, Dll proxying, persistence , elevation of privilege, and more.
