# Automation of Vulnerability Scanning and Payloads Generator

This program automates the process of vulnerability scanning and payload generation. It uses Procmon to monitor processes 
The program then analyzes the results of the scan and uses a variety of techniques to exploit these vulnerabilities.
# includings: 
- Privilege escalation. 
- DLL injection
- DLL proxying
- Persistence
- Elevation of privilege.

The program generates a full report for each vulnerable process, including details on the vulnerabilities and the techniques used to exploit them. The report is saved in the form of an Excel file, allowing for easy analysis and documentation. Additionally, the program generates a payload written in C++ for each vulnerable process, providing a ready-to-use exploit for the identified vulnerabilities.

# Requirements:
- Python.exe: The program is written in Python and requires a Python interpreter to run.
- Procmon.exe: This tool is used to monitor processes and identify potential vulnerabilities. It must be installed on the system in order to use the program.
- GCC compiler: The program generates payloads in C++, which requires a compiler to build the code. The GCC compiler is recommended for use with this program.

# Running the Program
To run the program, execute the main.py file. Procmon will run in the background, and the scan will run for the specified amount of time (1 hour by default). To specify a different amount of time, use the -t argument. For example: main.py -t 3h will run the scanner for 3 hours.

Upon completion of the scan, the program will analyze the results and generate a report and payload for each vulnerable process. An example folder is included, demonstrating the output for a scan of Teams.exe.

# Available Options:
- -t: Set the time for the scan (e.g. main.py -t 3h). The time should be specified in hours, using the format Xh, where X is the number of hours.
- -f: Set a filter for the techniques to use (e.g. main.py -f privilege escalation, persistence). 
- -p: Set the path for the results (e.g. main.py -p C:\result). This option allows you to specify the location where the reports and payloads will be saved.

I hope this revised version provides a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and usage of the program. Let me know if you have any further questions or need further assistance.
